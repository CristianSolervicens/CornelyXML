## CornelyXML
### Description
Jet another XML abstraction
### Dependencies
Depends on Ude to detect file encoding

Includes a simple app that shows how to work with the CornelyXML

## Hope it will be usefull for someone, it's based on another work: automatatheory-xml-parser here is the reference [https://github.com/gian-te/automatatheory-xml-parser]

## Â¿Why another XML abstraction?
I built this app because I have to work with some signed XML's that has some "problems" and the MS XMLDocument allways tries to fix them, so this app does not make changes to the original XML, otherwise the original signature is invalidated.
